Example:

# install it
C:\> gem install faster_gem_script

# install something to optimize

C:\> gem install whichr

C:\>whichr whichr
higher in the list is executed first
C:\installs\ruby19_mingw\bin\whichr.bat

C:\>faster_gem_script C:\installs\ruby19_mingw\bin\whichr

# now run it twice



C:\> timer whichr whichr
higher in the list is executed first
C:\installs\ruby19_mingw\bin\whichr.bat

2.484375

C:\dev\ruby\faster_gem_script>timer whichr whichr
higher in the list is executed first
C:\installs\ruby19_mingw\bin\whichr.bat

0.40625

Yea much faster now.

You can revert back to the original performance, too.

C:\> gem install whichr
C:\> timer whichr whichr
higher in the list is executed first
C:\installs\ruby19_mingw\bin\whichr.bat
